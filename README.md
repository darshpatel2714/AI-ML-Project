### 3. Training Process
- Data normalization and scaling
- 30 epochs with batch training
- Real-time loss tracking
- Progressive model improvement

### 4. Prediction
- Takes user input for house features
- Normalizes data using training parameters
- Runs inference through trained model
- Shows price estimate with confidence score
